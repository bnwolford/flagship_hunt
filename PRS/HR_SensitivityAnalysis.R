#sensitivity analysis for incident and prevalent cases in HUNT 



#we should be able to simply take the HRperSD script, add into Surv model Surv(age at recruitment, age at diagnosis, event)~...., and simply run the the analysis, as model will exclude everyone itself who has negative follow up, ie prevalent cases
3:43
no need to redefine anything
3:44
exepct the surv object as far as i can understand
3:45
and then we can make a graph on HR from agefodgn time scale and HR on entry,ageofdgn scale
